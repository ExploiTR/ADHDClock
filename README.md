## Why ADHDClock?

For individuals with ADHD, time blindness (difficulty perceiving the passage of time) can be a significant challenge. ADHDClock helps by:

- Providing a constant visual reminder of the current time
- Showing a countdown to the next alert for better time awareness
- Delivering auditory alerts at regular intervals to help maintain focus and task awareness
- Offering customization options to suit individual preferences and sensory needs
- Being unobtrusive while remaining effective
